# kBOT

kBOT is an ai aimbot that uses the yolov7 detection model, the streamer version doesnt show the detection visualization and is slightly faster, the normal version has a visualizer window that shows the detections/etc.

# FAQ

## Which games is kBOT compatible with?

kBOT is expected to work with games that have player models resembling human anatomy.

## How can I use kbot?

**Due to the valorant bypass I implemented you need to make sure there are no windows in the way of the image grabber, make sure the detection window sees just the game, you can check using a `normal` version.

To configure kBOT for your desired game, simply run the program, answer the questions it asks then use it! The firing key is currently 1 but that will be easily changeable in a future update.

## How do I make it use GPU?

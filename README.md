# kbot

A ai aimbot that I made that uses the yolov7 detection model, the normal.py shows a window that has the detection rendering, the streamer.py doesn't show the window and is slightly faster.

The proto files are prototypes of the end goal of smooth constant adjustments, when you run them it asks for 1 or 2, 1 shoots 2 doesn't, 
2 has about as smooth as I can get it aim but I'm still figuring out how to make it shoot well, 1 has little bit better than non proto aim
but not by much but it does shoot.

# FAQ

## What games does this work on?

This works on I'd assume any game that the players anatomy is similar to a human.

## How do I use it?

You change change the window title in the python code to be the game you want to use it on, currently its set
to csgo but just change that and it should work, once you run it and it detects somebody you can hold down 1 (changeable)
and then it will aim and shoot at the detected players (does not discriminate based on team).

# FAQ

## What games does this work on?

This works on I'd assume any game that the players anatomy is similar to a human.

## How do I use it?

You change change the window title in the python code to be the game you want to use it on, currently its set
to csgo but just change that and it should work, once you run it and it detects somebody you can hold down 1 (changeable)
and then it will aim and shoot at the detected players (does not discriminate based on team).


## I need help! 

just dm me on discord @kb.kb

# AIMR

AIMR is an ai aimbot that uses the yolov7 detection model, the streamer version doesnt show the detection visualization and is slightly faster, the normal version has a visualizer window that shows the detections/etc.

# NOTICES
- The mouse movements are not functioning in VALORANT but it will still work as a triggerbot.
- I'm pretty busy due to school so updates will mostly be on weekends
- Cannot be on fullscreen

# TODO
- Refine aim
- Create EXE's for no install running
- Fully make ESP
- Make a GUI
- Make a full tutorial and explain everything
- Make config files
- Reimplement changing aim button
- Widescreen support


# How to (Outdated)

- You'll need python
- If you don't have some modules download the "req.txt" and run "pip3 install -r req.txt"




# FAQ

## Which games is AIMR compatible with?

AIMR is expected to work with games that have player models resembling human anatomy.

## How can I use AIMR?

**Due to the valorant bypass I implemented you need to make sure there are no windows in the way of the image grabber, make sure the detection window sees just the game, you can check using a `normal` version.

To configure AIMR for your desired game, simply run the program, answer the questions it asks then use it! The firing key is set when you run it (V1.3).

## How do I make it use GPU (RTX-ONLY)?

# kbot

kbot is an AI aimbot that utilizes the yolov7 detection model. The `normal.py` file displays a window with the detection rendering, while the `streamer.py` file runs without displaying the window, resulting in slightly faster performance.

In the two weeks I've tested this on CS:GO I have not been banned.

The files with V serve as prototypes for achieving smooth and consistent adjustments. When executed, they prompt the user to choose between two options: 1 (shoot) and 2 (do not shoot). Option 1 provides a reasonably smooth aiming experience, with shooting (Set delay so may not be perfect for some weapons). Option 2 offers slightly better aiming performance than the option 1 version, but the shooting functionality is unimplemented.

# FAQ

## Which games is kbot compatible with?

kbot is expected to work with games that have player models resembling human anatomy.

## How can I use kbot?

To configure kbot for your desired game, simply modify the window title within the provided Python code. By default, it is set to work with CS:GO, but changing it should enable compatibility with other games, **make sure the game is windowed/windowed fullscreen**. Once executed and a player is detected, pressing and holding the assigned key (modifiable) will cause kbot to aim and shoot at the detected players, without differentiating between teams, I would recommend using this more as an assist, it's good for camping somewhere but not as good for run and gun.

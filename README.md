# kbot

kbot is an AI aimbot that utilizes the yolov7 detection model. The `normal.py` file displays a window with the detection rendering, while the `streamer.py` file runs without displaying the window, resulting in slightly faster performance.


In the time since creating this I have not been banned.

The files with V serve as prototypes for achieving smooth and consistent adjustments. When executed, they prompt the user to choose between two options: 1 (shoot) and 2 (do not shoot). Option 1 provides a reasonably smooth aiming experience, with shooting (Set delay so may not be perfect for some weapons). Option 2 offers slightly better aiming performance than the option 1 version, but the shooting functionality is unimplemented.

# NOTICES
- Currently the mouse movements are not functioning in VALORANT but it will still work as a triggerbot.
- Fortnite currently doesnt work due to it detected the player in 3rd person (BEING FIXED)
- You need to use right hand in csgo (BEING FIXED)
- I'm pretty busy due to school so updates will mostly be on weekends

# TODO
- Refine aim
- Fully make ESP
- Make a GUI
- Add options for the blocked detection areas
- Make a full tutorial and explain everything
- Reupload new versions to repo

# FAQ

## Which games is kbot compatible with?

kbot is expected to work with games that have player models resembling human anatomy.

## How can I use kbot?

**Due to the valorant bypass I implemented you need to make sure there are no windows in the way of the image grabber, make sure the detection window sees just the game, you can check using a `normal` version.

To configure kbot for your desired game, simply modify the window title within the provided Python code. By default, it is set to work with CS:GO, but changing it should enable compatibility with other games, **make sure the game is windowed/windowed fullscreen**. Once executed and a player is detected, pressing and holding the assigned key (modifiable) will cause kbot to aim and shoot at the detected players, without differentiating between teams, I would recommend using this more as an assist, it works but not enough that in high stakes you don't need to move your mouse.

## How do I make it use GPU?
